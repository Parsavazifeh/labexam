## i only have one bad memory so i will tell you this my first term in university was perfect and i can say i learn alot of thing so my favorite memories was when we managed to build an actual website in internet which was about my profile and life after that we made a huge devlopment and create an actual website that worked and could be used by another people which is at 400522283.pythonanywhere.com and was made with django and third one wich is not finished yet is about making a 2 minute film that show the beauty of the math when its turned into art which is called (mandelbrotset) by the way the only bad memory i had was when i couldn't do as good as everyone on my django project.
